    <h3>Reflections on Freshman Year of College</h3>
    <div class="article-meta">
      <p>6 Jun 2019<br />Kevin Lutz</p>
    </div>
    <p>I have been out of school now for about 3 weeks and I figured now is a good time to recap my first year college experience. So far,
    college has been the best time of my life and I am so excited for it to continue for the next three years. Over the past 9 months I have
    met so many incredible people and had so many great times. I've seen myself grow into a person I never thought I would be; more outgoing,
    excited to meet new people, eager to go out and do things, and overall just happier. I have always been a quiet and reserved person, and
    to a great extent I still am, but so much has changed in such a short period of time, and in a very good way. I believe it is this social
    growth that gave me the drive and courage to go and get my first job, which I am absolutely loving as well! I have become more spontaneous
    and adventurous. More open to try new things and talk to people. I have learned to own who I am and show it to the world.<br /><br />
    I didn't <i>only</i> learn social skills in college, of course. I have learned so much about Java to where I am comfortable calling it one of
    my main languages. College has also forced me to learn how to take good notes and study. Never throughout my entire academic career leading up
    to college had I ever studied for anything, not even the SAT. It was when finals week rolled around during my first semester when I realized
    how much I didn't remember the material for my Ancient Philosophy class. For the first time, I had to study. It all paid off in the end however,
    in my first semester I got straight A's and ended up with a 3.88 GPA, landing myself on the highest honor Dean's list. That success continued
    into my second semester (as long as we don't count Calculus), and my overall cumulative GPA is now a 3.53. I hope to continue this trend of
    academic growth and success into the next 3 years at Pace.<br /><br />
    All in all, college has been a period of extreme personal growth for me and I'm only a quarter of the way through. I am so excited to see what
    else college has in store for me, as I'm sure it will be awesome.

    <h3>5 Technology Trends To Keep An Eye On in 2019</h3>
    <div class="article-meta">
      <p>2 Feb 2019<br />Kevin Lutz</p>
    </div>
    <p>This article discusses some of the most popular things in tech to look forward to and keep an eye on for 2019.</p>
    <h4>1. Truly Bezel-less Smartphones</h4>
    <p>2018 was the year of the "notch". That horrible eyesore that houses front-facing camera and speaker equipment in most flagship
      smartphones released during the year. I hope and believe that companies will find ways to clean up the "foreheads" and "chins" of
      smartphones in 2019. Some beacons of hope include mechanical implementations such as in the Oppo X and the hole-punch idea shown by
      Samsung.</p>
    <h4>2. Self-Driving and (more) Electric Cars</h4>
    <p>We saw some big name, longstanding automotive companies add some electric cars to their lineups. I predict that we will
      see these a lot more of this in 2019. Along with cars becoming electric, we should see greater advancements in self-driving cars as
      more companies compete with Tesla in this space. This is big news for the future of taxis, long distance shipping hauls, etc. One
      potential benefit could be reduced prices for express shipping from large companies that can afford to acquire a fleet of self-driving
      electric cars.
    </p>
    <div id="2-02-2019-more">
      <h4>3. Foldable Smartphones</h4>
      <p>This one I believe is the most bold of the predictions on this list. Mainly because moving pieces = less reliability. However,
        it is interesting to think that we may soon be able to have a device that can effectively function as both a tablet and a pocket-sized
        phone. The early demonstrations shown at CES are not very promising, with odd screen glitches occurring during transition and a whole lot
        of bulk. The glitches are to be expected with early proof of concept devices, but people won't buy a phone that is an inch thick when
        folded after years of trying to slim down our devices.</p>
      <h4>4. Quantum Computing</h4>
      <p>Although it is still in it's infancy and certainly isn't tailored to consumers, quantum computing should make some significant progress
        in 2019. IBM is the forerunner of the quantum computing realm with their IBM Q. To me, the most interesting thing about IBM Q is that
        anyone can tinker with it. Without a doubt, opening up a technology to everyone is the best way to move it forward. There is a steep
        learning curve, but you can try your hand at quantum logic on <a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/editor">IBM's Q Experience</a>.</p>
      <h4>5. Security Breaches followed by Improved Cyber Security</h4>
      <p>This prediction is already showing itself with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/tech/apple-face-time-bug/index.html">Apple's group FaceTime bug</a>.
        Security breaches, exploits, and information leaks are never good. Unfortunately, expect to see a few big ones in 2019. The cat and mouse
        game between hackers and cyber security professionals gets crazier and more serious each year, and 2019 will be no different. The good thing
        about these things happening is that it makes things more secure for the future. Just as hackers come up with new ways to exploit, companies
        come up with better ways to stop them. Let's just hope that most of these events in 2019 are harmless.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the blog section of my website! I plan to write articles here pertaining to technology news, web development, and perhaps some of my
      other interests. If this gains somewhat of an audience I may move it to it's own dedicated site. In the meantime, it shall live here on my
      portfolio site. I hope you find what I have to say interesting, enjoy!</p>
